# 🛣️ Simple Route Planning for Different Users

## 🤔 **Think Like This:**

```
🏠 Your API = A Big Building
📁 Routes = Different Floors  
🚪 Each Floor = For Different People
```

---

## 📝 **Step 1: What Can Each User Do?**

Write down what each user type can do:

### **👨‍🌾 Farmers Can:**
```
✏️ Add their products
👀 See their own products  
✏️ Update their products
❌ Delete their products
👀 See orders for their products
✏️ Update order status (shipped, etc.)
👀 See their earnings
✏️ Update their profile
```

### **🛒 Customers Can:**
```
👀 Browse all products
👀 Search products
👀 See product details
✏️ Add to cart
👀 See their cart
✏️ Place orders
👀 See their order history
✏️ Cancel their orders
✏️ Rate/review products
✏️ Update their profile
```

### **👨‍💼 Admin Can:**
```
👀 See all users
👀 See all products
👀 See all orders
✏️ Approve/reject farmers
✏️ Approve/reject products
❌ Delete bad products
❌ Ban users
👀 See platform analytics
✏️ Manage categories
```

## 🏗️ **Step 2: Group Routes by User Type**

### **🔓 Public Routes (Anyone can access):**
```
Authentication:
POST   /api/auth/register
POST   /api/auth/login
POST   /api/auth/forgot-password

Public browsing:
GET    /api/products              → See all products
GET    /api/products/:id          → See one product
GET    /api/products/search       → Search products
GET    /api/categories            → See categories
```

### **👨‍🌾 Farmer Routes (Only farmers):**
```
My Products:
GET    /api/farmer/products       → My products
POST   /api/farmer/products       → Add new product
PUT    /api/farmer/products/:id   → Update my product
DELETE /api/farmer/products/:id   → Delete my product

My Orders:
GET    /api/farmer/orders         → Orders for my products
PUT    /api/farmer/orders/:id     → Update order status

My Business:
GET    /api/farmer/analytics      → My sales data
GET    /api/farmer/earnings       → My earnings
PUT    /api/farmer/profile        → Update my profile
```

### **🛒 Customer Routes (Only customers):**
```

GET    /api/customer/cart         → My cart
POST   /api/customer/cart         → Add to cart
PUT    /api/customer/cart/:id     → Update cart item
DELETE /api/customer/cart/:id     → Remove from cart

My Orders:
GET    /api/customer/orders       → My order history
POST   /api/customer/orders       → Place new order
PUT    /api/customer/orders/:id   → Cancel order

My Account:
GET    /api/customer/addresses    → My addresses
POST   /api/customer/addresses    → Add address
PUT    /api/customer/profile      → Update profile

Reviews:
POST   /api/customer/reviews      → Add review
PUT    /api/customer/reviews/:id  → Update my review
```

### **👨‍💼 Admin Routes (Only admin):**
```
User Management:
GET    /api/admin/users           → All users

## 🎯 **Step 3: Route Patterns**

### **Pattern 1: By Role**
```
/api/farmer/*     → Only farmers can access
/api/customer/*   → Only customers can access  
/api/admin/*      → Only admin can access
```

### **Pattern 2: By Resource + Role**
```
/api/products           → Public (everyone)
/api/farmer/products    → Farmer's own products
/api/admin/products     → Admin sees all products
```

### **Pattern 3: Authentication Level**
```
/api/auth/*       → No login needed
/api/public/*     → No login needed
/api/protected/*  → Login required (any role)
/api/farmer/*     → Login + farmer role required
```

## 🏠 **Step 4: Your Farm to Home Route Structure**

```

## 🔐 **Step 5: How Authentication Works**

### **Route Protection:**
```javascript
// Public routes - no login needed
app.use('/api/auth', authRoutes);
app.use('/api/public', publicRoutes);

// Protected routes - login required
app.use('/api/farmer', authenticateUser, checkFarmerRole, farmerRoutes);
app.use('/api/customer', authenticateUser, checkCustomerRole, customerRoutes);
app.use('/api/admin', authenticateUser, checkAdminRole, adminRoutes);
```

### **Middleware Chain:**
```
Request → Check if logged in → Check user role → Allow access
```

---

## 📋 **Step 6: Quick Planning Template**

**For ANY app, use this template:**

### **1. List what each user can do:**
```
User Type 1 can: [list 5-8 actions]
User Type 2 can: [list 5-8 actions]  
User Type 3 can: [list 5-8 actions]
```

### **2. Group by access level:**
```
Public routes: [what everyone can do]
Protected routes: [what logged-in users can do]
Role-specific routes: [what each role can do]
```

### **3. Create URL structure:**
```
/api/auth/*
/api/public/*
/api/[role1]/*
/api/[role2]/*
/api/admin/*
```

---

## 🎯 **Examples for Other Apps:**

### **📱 Social Media App:**
```
📁 /api/
├── 🔓 auth/ (register, login)
├── 🌐 public/ (trending posts, explore)
├── 👤 user/ (my posts, my feed, follow)
├── 🎭 creator/ (analytics, monetization)
└── 👨‍💼 admin/ (moderate, ban users)
```

### **🎓 Learning App:**
```
📁 /api/
├── 🔓 auth/ (register, login)
├── 🌐 public/ (browse courses)
├── 🎓 student/ (my courses, progress)
├── 👨‍🏫 teacher/ (create courses, analytics)
└── 👨‍💼 admin/ (approve courses, manage)
```

---

## ✅ **Your Action Plan:**

### **Step 1: Plan on paper (10 minutes)**
Write down:
1. What farmers can do (8 actions)
2. What customers can do (10 actions)  
3. What admin can do (6 actions)

### **Step 2: Group into routes (10 minutes)**
Turn each action into a URL:
- Farmer actions → `/api/farmer/*`
- Customer actions → `/api/customer/*`
- Admin actions → `/api/admin/*`

### **Step 3: Start building (this week)**
Build routes in this order:
1. **Week 1:** `/api/auth/*` (register, login)
2. **Week 2:** `/api/farmer/products` (add/get products)
3. **Week 3:** `/api/customer/orders` (place orders)
4. **Week 4:** `/api/admin/users` (manage users)

**Key tip: Build one route at a time, test it, then move to the next!**

This route structure will make your API super organized and easy to understand! 🚀
